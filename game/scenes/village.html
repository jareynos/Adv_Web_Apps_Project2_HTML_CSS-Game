<h1>The Silent Village</h1>

<p>
The village should be bustling at this hour, yet the streets are empty.
Doors are barred, windows shuttered.  
Even the livestock are silent.
</p>

<p>
A strange pressure hangs in the air — as though the star’s fall has frightened
the very heartbeat of the town.
